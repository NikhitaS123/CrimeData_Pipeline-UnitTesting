This file contains a Pipeline for a Crime Data Project.
It has taken Police Data from two Police Forces-Sussex Police and Dyfed-Powyls Police: Their street and outcome datasets for Jan 2022-Dec 2023
I have also added a Postcode column used from another dataset & an ethnicity sheet from a Government website.

There are functions in this Pipeline that work for all 3 datasets, and a few that tailor to specific needs of particular dataframes.

Each function has been logged onto a separate logging file which will appear in C:\Users\YourName

Unit Tests have also been conducted on the pipeline functions using relevant data to the dataset and random data to show the functions 'universal' nature.
